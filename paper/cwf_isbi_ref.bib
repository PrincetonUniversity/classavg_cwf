The requirements imposed on software by such data processing are exemplified by the design considerations of the IMAGIC-5 software system. This system includes facilities for multivariate statistical analysis of large data sets, for correlation averaging of two-dimensional crystals, and for three-dimensional reconstruction of macromolecular structures. The molecules may be arranged as two-dimensional crystals, as helices, or as single particles with arbitrary pointgroup symmetry. IMAGIC's novel angular reconstitution approach allows for the rapid determination of three-dimensional structures of uncrystallized molecules to high resolution. The general organization, user interaction strategy, file structure, and extendibility of IMAGIC are discussed and illustrated with some practical examples."

The user-level programs are better documented, more straightforward to use, and written in the Python scripting language, so advanced users can modify the programs? behavior without any recompilation. A completely rewritten 3D transformation class simplifies translation between Euler angle standards and symmetry conventions. The core C++ library has over 500 functions for image processing and associated tasks, and it is modular with introspection capabilities, so programmers can add new algorithms with minimal effort and programs can incorporate new capabilities automatically. Finally, a flexible new parallelism system has been designed to address the shortcomings in the rigid system in EMAN1. "

This paper describes developments that reduce the computational costs of the underlying maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm, as well as statistical considerations that yield new insights into the accuracy with which the relative orientations of individual particles may be determined. A so-called gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) procedure to prevent overfitting is also described. The resulting implementation yields high-quality reconstructions and reliable resolution estimates with minimal user intervention and at acceptable computational costs. "

Both image classification and high-resolution refinement have been accelerated up to 40-fold, and template-based particle selection has been accelerated almost 1000-fold on desktop hardware. Memory requirements on GPUs have been reduced to fit widely available hard- ware, and we show that the use of single precision arithmetic does not adversely affect results.

Specimen preparation methods perform the seemingly impossible task of stabilizing the initially hydrated molecule so that it can be placed and observed in the vacuum. The contrast generated by the molecule itself is normally inadequate for direct observation in the electron microscope. Various contrasting methods have been developed. Negative staining with heavy metal salts such as uranyl acetate produces a high contrast and prevents the molecule from collapsing. Instead of the molecule, with its interior density variations, only a cast of the exterior surface of the molecule is imaged and only its shape can be reconstructed. To some extent, a stain may penetrate into crevices, but this does not change the fact that only the boundary of the molecule is visualized. As sophisticated averaging methods were developed, it became possible to make sense of the faint images produced by the molecule itself, but biologically relevant information could be obtained only after methods were found to sustain the molecule in a medium that closely approximates the aqueous environment; these methods are embedment in glucose, tannic acid, and vitreous ice. The chapter also describes gold-labeling techniques that are crucial in 3D electron microscopy. "

Here, a semi-automated particle selection procedure is presented that has been implemented within the open-source software RELION. At the heart of the procedure lies a fully CTF-corrected template-based picking algorithm, which is supplemented by a fast sorting algorithm and reference-free 2D class averaging to remove false positives. With only limited user-interaction, the proposed procedure yields results that are comparable to manual particle selection. Together with an improved graphical user interface, these developments further contribute to turning \{RELION\} from a stand-alone refinement program into a convenient image processing pipeline for the entire single-particle approach.

abstract = "Abstract Resolution measures in molecular electron microscopy provide means to evaluate quality of macromolecular structures computed from sets of their two-dimensional (2D) line projections. When the amount of detail in the computed density map is low there are no external standards by which the resolution of the result can be judged. Instead, resolution measures in molecular electron microscopy evaluate consistency of the results in reciprocal space and present it as a one-dimensional (1D) function of the modulus of spatial frequency. Here we provide description of standard resolution measures commonly used in electron microscopy. We point out that the organizing principle is the relationship between these measures and the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) of the computed density map. Within this framework it becomes straightforward to describe the connection between the outcome of resolution evaluations and the quality of electron microscopy maps, in particular, the optimum filtration, in the Wiener sense, of the computed map. We also provide a discussion of practical difficulties of evaluation of resolution in electron microscopy, particularly in terms of its sensitivity to data processing operations used during structure determination process in single particle analysis and in electron tomography (ET).

abstract ={Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) yields images of macromolecular assemblies and their components, from which 3D structures can be determined, by using an image processing method commonly known as ?single-particle reconstruction.? During the past two decades, this technique has become an important tool for 3D structure determination, but it generally has not been possible to determine atomic models. In principle, individual molecular images contain high-resolution information contaminated by a much higher level of noise. In practice, it has been unclear whether current averaging methods are adequate to extract this information from the background. We present here a reconstruction, obtained by using recently developed image processing methods, of the rotavirus inner capsid particle (?double-layer particle? or DLP) at a resolution suitable for interpretation by an atomic model. The result establishes single-particle reconstruction as a high-resolution technique. We show by direct comparison that the cryo-EM reconstruction of viral protein 6 (VP6) of the rotavirus DLP is similar in clarity to a 3.8-Å resolution map obtained from x-ray crystallography. At this resolution, most of the amino acid side chains produce recognizable density. The icosahedral symmetry of the particle was an important factor in achieving this resolution in the cryo-EM analysis, but as the size of recordable datasets increases, single-particle reconstruction also is likely to yield structures at comparable resolution from samples of much lower symmetry. This potential has broad implications for structural cell biology.},

abstract ={We present a randomized algorithm for the approximate nearest neighbor problem in d-dimensional Euclidean space. Given N points {xj} in , the algorithm attempts to find k nearest neighbors for each of xj, where k is a user-specified integer parameter. The algorithm is iterative, and its running time requirements are proportional to T·N·(d·(log d) + k·(d + log k)·(log N)) + N·k2·(d + log k), with T the number of iterations performed. The memory requirements of the procedure are of the order N·(d + k). A by-product of the scheme is a data structure, permitting a rapid search for the k nearest neighbors among {xj} for an arbitrary point . The cost of each such query is proportional to T·(d·(log d) + log(N/k)·k·(d + log k)), and the memory requirements for the requisite data structure are of the order N·(d + k) + T·(d + N). The algorithm utilizes random rotations and a basic divide-and-conquer scheme, followed by a local graph search. We analyze the scheme?s behavior for certain types of distributions of {xj} and illustrate its performance via several numerical examples.},

abstract = {We present an efficient and accurate algorithm for principal component analysis (PCA) of a large set of two-dimensional images and, for each image, the set of its uniform rotations in the plane and its reflection. The algorithm starts by expanding each image, originally given on a Cartesian grid, in the Fourier\&\#x2013;Bessel basis for the disk. Because the images are essentially band limited in the Fourier domain, we use a sampling criterion to truncate the Fourier\&\#x2013;Bessel expansion such that the maximum amount of information is preserved without the effect of aliasing. The constructed covariance matrix is invariant to rotation and reflection and has a special block diagonal structure. PCA is efficiently done for each block separately. This Fourier Bessel-based PCA detects more meaningful eigenimages and has improved denoising capability compared to traditional PCA for a finite number of noisy images.},

This is achieved through anisotropic diffusion kernels on observable data manifolds that approximate a Laplacian on the inaccessible independent variable domain. The key idea is a symmetrized second-order approximation of the unknown distances in the independent variable domain, using the metric distortion induced by the Jacobian of the unknown mapping from variables to data. This distortion is estimated using local principal component analysis. Thus, the non-linear independent component analysis problem is solved whenever the generation of the data enables the estimation of the Jacobian. In particular, we obtain the non-linear independent components of stochastic Itô processes and indicate other possible applications."

abstract ={In this paper, we present a method for time series analysis based on empirical intrinsic geometry (EIG). EIG enables one to reveal the low-dimensional parametric manifold as well as to infer the underlying dynamics of high-dimensional time series. By incorporating concepts of information geometry, this method extends existing geometric analysis tools to support stochastic settings and parametrizes the geometry of empirical distributions. However, the statistical models are not required as priors; hence, EIG may be applied to a wide range of real signals without existing definitive models. We show that the inferred model is noise-resilient and invariant under different observation and instrumental modalities. In addition, we show that it can be extended efficiently to newly acquired measurements in a sequential manner. These two advantages enable us to revisit the Bayesian approach and incorporate empirical dynamics and intrinsic geometry into a nonlinear filtering framework. We show applications to nonlinear and non-Gaussian tracking problems as well as to acoustic signal localization.},

We show that eigenfunctions of Markov matrices can be used to construct coordinates called diffusion maps that generate efficient representations of complex geometric structures. The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, defines multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods."

This paper considers a general problem of learning from pairwise constraints in the form of must-links and cannot-links. As one kind of side information, a must-link indicates the pair of the two data points must be in a same class, while a cannot-link indicates that the two data points must be in two different classes. Given must-link and cannot-link information, our goal is to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric. Under this metric, we hope the distances of point pairs in must-links are as small as possible and those of point pairs in cannot-links are as large as possible. This task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, in which the global optimum can be obtained effectively and efficiently. Finally, some applications in data clustering, interactive natural image segmentation and face pose estimation are given in this paper. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. "

abstract = "Abstract The problem of image restoration in cryo-EM entails correcting for the effects of the Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) and noise. Popular methods for image restoration include ?phase flipping?, which corrects only for the Fourier phases but not amplitudes, and Wiener filtering, which requires the spectral signal to noise ratio. We propose a new image restoration method which we call ?Covariance Wiener Filtering? (CWF). In CWF, the covariance matrix of the projection images is used within the classical Wiener filtering framework for solving the image restoration deconvolution problem. Our estimation procedure for the covariance matrix is new and successfully corrects for the CTF. We demonstrate the efficacy of \{CWF\} by applying it to restore both simulated and experimental cryo-EM images. Results with experimental datasets demonstrate that \{CWF\} provides a good way to evaluate the particle images and to see what the dataset contains even without 2D classification and averaging. "
